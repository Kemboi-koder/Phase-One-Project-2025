Introduction

It is said that flying is among the safest and fastest ways to travel despite the number of aviation accidents that have occurred throughout the years. The aviation industry is a lucrative and fast growing sector in transport. That being mentioned, my project aims to use aviation data to identify the risk factors that contribute to accidents and how they relate to specific public and private aircraft carriers to make informed decisions on which aircraft models are best suited for a company trying to venture into the industry.
Project overview

In this project using NTSB Aviation data(1962- 2023), the aim is to identify which aircraft carriers are less likely to cause fatal accidents in order to purchase these aircraft to venture into the business. The data will be first reviewed to farmiliarise with the indexes and columns.Next it will be checked for missing values and all unecessary datasets cleared.Computation is done where needed and finally we perfom analysisi with visualizations and provide recommendations and insights.
